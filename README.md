# UFOs
Module 11

# Overview of Project: 
Dana wanted to display an organized table with UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. I created a website using Javascript with a filter so she could search data about UFO sightnings.

# Results:

This is the Website:

You can search data here:

# Summary:
A major drawback is that the people searching for the data must know the specific date, city etc. to pull the information. The filters also require correct lower case spelling.
